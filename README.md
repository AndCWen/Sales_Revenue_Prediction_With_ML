#Sales Revenue Prediction using Linear Regression

##Overview
Predicting future sales revenue is crucial for strategic planning and decision-making in business. This repository demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression machine learning model to predict sales revenue based on historical data. The example uses dummy sales data generated by ChatGPT.

##Project Highlights
- Data Generation: Dummy sales data is created to simulate realistic scenarios.
- Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
- Feature Engineering: Prepare the data by selecting relevant features for the model.
- Model Training: Implement linear regression and train the model on historical data.
- Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error.
- Prediction: Utilize the trained model to predict sales revenue for future months.
